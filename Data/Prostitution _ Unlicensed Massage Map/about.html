    <h2>Rachel Tam</h2>
    <h3>I am a senior at Brown studying Gender and Sexuality Studies + Biology.
        I am the student coordinator for BURP (Brown University Relaxation Project)
        which is a student group that trains volunteers to provide free massages.
        I wrote a gender and sexuality studies honors thesis this year on
        Crisis Pregnancy Centres in Rhode Island, focusing on how they operate
        and the nationwide networks of CPCs in the US.

    <h5>Hello, my name is Mona, and I am a junior currently pursuing a degree in Ethnic Studies.
        My primary focus is on health disparities and how various systems of power interact
        with access to care. My interest in this field has led me to explore the
        use of oral histories and archival work to better understand the experiences
        of marginalized communities. Currently, I am working on a project related to
        mental health and anti-policing, which involves examining the impact of law
        enforcement on mental health outcomes in vulnerable populations.
